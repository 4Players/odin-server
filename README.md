# ODIN Server

![v0.5.23](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.5.23-blue?style=for-the-badge)

ODIN is a cross-platform software development kit (SDK) that enables developers to integrate real-time chat technology into multiplayer games, apps and websites.

[Online Documentation](https://www.4players.io/developers/)

This repository provides a collection of scripts and configuration files for running an on-premise ODIN server. The ODIN server is a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU), which connects users in mutual rooms by acting as a relay for media and data.

  end

  C4("Client 4")

  C3 --> R1 & R3
  C4 --> R1 & R3
```

## Configuration

The server is configured using a configuration file and optional command-line arguments.

**Note:** For local testing, using [mkcert][mkcert] is recommended to generate certificates.


### Command-Line arguments

| Option      | Description              | Default Value  | 
| :---------- | :----------------------- | :------------- |
| `--config`  | Path to the config file  | `config.toml`  |
| `--license` | Path to the license file | `license.toml` |

Here's an example on how to start the server using a custom config path.

```bash
./grid --config /etc/grid/config.toml
```


### The `config.toml` file

You can change the behavior of your ODIN server by modifying its configuration file called `config.toml`, which uses the [TOML][toml] format.


#### `verbosity`

The verbosity level `[0-3]` to define how much information should be written to logs.

```toml
verbosity = 1
```

#### `public_address` <sub><sup>*Required*</sub></sup>

The FQDN and port number where the server can be reached from the Internet.

```toml
public_address = "localhost:4433"
```


### The `[supervisor]` section

The `[supervisor]` section allows you to attach your server instance to an external [gateway][odin-gateway-url], which can be used for scalability in your hosting infrastructure. It is expected to be specified on the root level.

#### `url` <sub><sup>*Required*</sub></sup>

The full web address of the supervisor to contact and send reports to.

```toml
url = "http://localhost:7000/internal"
```


#### `report_interval`

The time in milliseconds between consecutive reports to the supervisor.

```toml
report_interval = 5_000
```

#### `no_warmup`

When true, the server wait for one report cycle before starting to send reports to the supervisor.

```toml
no_warmup = false
```

#### `version`

A freely pickable number to send with reports. This is currently unused, but reserved for future usage.

```toml
version = 123456
```


### The `[authorization]` section

The ODIN server uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with EdDSA/Ed25519 signature for client authorization. The `[authorization]` section can be used to change the behavior of this process.

#### `allow_unsigned`

Then true, the server will accept logins using unsigned tokens. It is strongly recommended, that you do **NOT** enable this in a production environment.

```toml
allow_unsigned = false
```

#### `leeway`

The number of milliseconds a login token can be before or beyond its valid time period and still pass.

```toml
leeway = 5_000
```


### The `[[authorization.keys]]` section

The `[[authorization.keys]]` section is used to define a list of keys allowed to sign login tokens. When using a `[supervisor]`, this section can be omitted as it will be automatically generated by the [gateway][odin-gateway-url].

```toml
[[authorization.keys]]
kid = "Afkwfu4BVHDh"
kty = "OKP"
crv = "Ed25519"
x = "a5J2bhmU7vsY0LrW1zt56iUdmhRUNz7Pl9eBoCy29d8"
d = "5FYw1qdABjE0qEKEe821L7UPl_DZfO-PavpaiLsGDR0"
```

**Note:** You can use the [@4players/odin-cli][odin-cli-url] package to generate this section for you.

## Examples

Create a configuration file and use the `grid` executable to start the ODIN server.


### Minimal `config.toml` for Supervised Server

When running the ODIN server in combination with a [gateway][odin-gateway-url], you only need to specify the web address of the supervisor. The server will register with the supervisor and automatically receive recommended settings, which will be used to extend the local `config.toml` file.

The recommended configuration of the gateway can be defined [here][odin-gateway-config-url].

```toml
public_address = "server.tld:4433"

[supervisor]
url = "http://username:password@localhost:7000/internal"
```


### Minimal `config.toml` for Standalone Server

When running the ODIN server in standalone mode, you need to specify at least one JWK used for authorization pair as well as the binding and certificate configuration for incoming client connections.

```toml
public_address = "server.tld:4433"

[[authorization.keys]]
kid = "Afkwfu4BVHDh"
kty = "OKP"
crv = "Ed25519"
x = "a5J2bhmU7vsY0LrW1zt56iUdmhRUNz7Pl9eBoCy29d8"
d = "5FYw1qdABjE0qEKEe821L7UPl_DZfO-PavpaiLsGDR0"

[quic]
binding = "0.0.0.0:4433"
certificate_file = "fullchain.pem"
privatekey_file = "privkey.pem"

[http]
binding = "0.0.0.0:4433"
certificate_file = "fullchain.pem"
privatekey_file = "privkey.pem"
webrtc_binding = "0.0.0.0:5000"
```
